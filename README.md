# PracticumSP25 – NCAA Basketball Spread Prediction

## Overview

**PracticumSP25** is a machine learning pipeline built to predict **NCAA Basketball game outcomes against the spread**.  
Developed as part of the **Georgia Tech Spring 2025 Practicum**, this project focuses on modeling team performance, generating advanced features, and making real-time spread-based predictions.

### Key Features

- Data cleaning and feature engineering for NCAA basketball stats  
- Model training and evaluation pipelines  
- Prediction generation for upcoming matchups against the spread  
- Entry dictionary support for bulk prediction use cases

## Installation/Instructions

**Note**: This project assumes your *working directory* for all scripts is the root folder. Adjust all pathing of scripts appropriately based on source/target destination folders.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PracticumSP25.git
   cd PracticumSP25-main
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**
   Use the provided full environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate practicumsp25
   ```

3. **Place Your Data In a Project Directory in the root folder of the repo**
   ```bash
   Example: Project_Data, Data_Inputs, etc.
   ```

## How to Use the Scripts

All core functionality is located in the `deliverable/scripts/` directory.

### 1. Train the Model
Builds and saves the models used for prediction.
```bash
python deliverable/scripts/build_model.py
```

### 2. Generate Predictions
Entry dictionaries (in `entrydicts/`) specify the teams and games to predict. This script outputs spread predictions using the trained model.
```bash
python deliverable/scripts/online_predictions.py
```

> This step **requires** models generated by `build_model.py`.

### 3. Full Pipeline Execution
Runs feature engineering, model training, and prediction in one go. You can optionally run specific components if a prebuilt model has already been trained and tested.

Once again, please update directories and folders based on the path of where the script is executing. Relative pathing is used to:
 - Create folders
 - Create relevant files
 - Output model results
 - Calculate prediction results.

 If adding more data to train the model, please update **helper_function.py** script to accomodate the new season in line 63

 ```python
if "23-24" in fname and "teamsdf" in target_fname:
   data_file['season'] = '23-24'
elif "24-25" in fname and "teamsdf" in target_fname:
   data_file['season'] = '24-25'
## Add additional elif here for new data
else:
   pass
 ```

```bash
python deliverable/scripts/final_script.py
```

## Dependencies

This project uses a wide range of packages for data processing, machine learning, and modeling.  
**Use the full `environment.yml` file** to avoid any missing dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

> Individual package installs are not supported — the full environment is required.
